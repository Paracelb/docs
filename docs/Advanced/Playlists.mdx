## It's not difficult to create custom playlists!

---

### Step 1: Making your playlist

- Run the `- pl-create` command plus the name of the playlist you want to create along with the first song/playlist you want to add.


### Step 2: Playing your custom playlist

- Run the `- pl-load` command followed by the playlist you wish to load.


## Optional steps:

### Viewing your custom playlist

- The `- pl-view` command allows you to view your available playlists as well as hone in on a specific one.



### Deleting a specific song from a custom playlist

- The `- pl-remove` command lets you delete a specific track number from your custom playlist. You can find the track number by running `- pl-view <playlist>` and then `- pl-remove <song number>`.

### Deleting a custom playlist

- All you have to do to delete a custom playlist is run the `- pl-delete` command and then enter the playlist name you would like to delete.
